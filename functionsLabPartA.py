# Problem 1: Basic Function and Return Value
# Write a function called 'square' that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.
# Test the function by printing the square of 4, 7, and 10.






# Problem 2-3: Scope of Variables
# Write a function called 'outer' that declares a variable 'x' inside it, sets it to 10, and prints it.







# Problem 4: Conditional Return Values
# Write a function called 'divisible_by_3' that takes an integer as a parameter.
# The function should return True if the number is divisible by 3, otherwise return False.
# Test the function by calling it with different numbers.






# Problem 5: Multiple Return Values
# Create a function called min_max that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns both the smallest and largest numbers. 
# Test the function by printing both the minimum and maximum.
